## Week Three
##### What's New
This week was more productive then the last because I dove deeper into the Grep which searches the lines for specific word that the Grep command wass programed to look for the word or phrase typed. I used the command 'grep money' to let the coupter know that to look for words that had "money" in it. I played around with it so I could further my understand how to command works. 

##### What's Next?
What I would like to accomplish during this week is to instead of looking at tutorials and taking notes, I actually want to start writing code so I can increase my understanding of my study and by Friday have an idea of how this project would look in it's final form.

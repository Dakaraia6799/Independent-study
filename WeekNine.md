#Week Nine
This week is week nine of my independent project so all week I have been going over how I will possible be able to inform my peers on eveerything I have learned in under 5 minutes. So I decided to talk about why I picked this topic in the first place. I picked Shell Scripting because after entering the program late and having to catch up to the rest of the class. After really pushing through ruby I decided for my final project I would try something that would be something I was very sure I would be able to takle. The last two days I have been preparing my presention so when I step infornt of my peers it would be easier for me to remember what to go over. I also asked my mother for help so she can tell me if the information I was giving was understandable for a person who do not use technology oftenly. another grep command I was using was grep -v *keyword which tells the computer to to look for the keyword and remove them from the line.
